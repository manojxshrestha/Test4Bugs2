# Advanced Manual Bug Hunting Using Google Dorking

## Introduction
This guide provides a comprehensive manual for **advanced bug hunting** using **Google Dorking techniques** in 2025. It covers finding **sensitive information**, **exposed databases**, **misconfigured cloud services**, and **logic flaws** in web applications.

## 1. Advanced Dorking Techniques

### a. Finding Configuration Files with Sensitive Data
Configuration files can contain highly sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, and user data. Look for these file types:

- `.ini`, `.conf`, `.env`, `.xml`, `.properties`, `.db`, `.json`, `.cnf`, `.config`

#### **Dorks:**
```
filetype:conf OR filetype:ini OR filetype:properties "password" OR "secret" OR "db_password"
filetype:env OR filetype:json "AWS_ACCESS_KEY" OR "API_KEY" OR "password"
site:example.com filetype:xml "api_key" OR "db_password" OR "db_host"
site:example.com filetype:bak OR filetype:zip "database" OR "confidential"
```

---

### b. Searching for Source Code and Logic Leaks
Many vulnerabilities stem from source code being exposed or logic flaws being inadvertently revealed in public repositories.

#### **Dorks:**
```
filetype:php OR filetype:js OR filetype:py "eval(" OR "exec(" OR "password" -github
filetype:sql "DROP TABLE" OR "SELECT * FROM" OR "user_password"
filetype:txt "confidential" OR "private" OR "secrets"
```

---

### c. Exposing Database Backups and SQL Dumps
Database dumps often contain full tables, including critical data like usernames, passwords, and customer information.

#### **Dorks:**
```
filetype:sql OR filetype:bak OR filetype:tgz "CREATE DATABASE" OR "INSERT INTO" "users" OR "password"
filetype:tar.gz OR filetype:zip "dump" OR "backup" "database"
site:example.com filetype:sql "DROP DATABASE" OR "SELECT * FROM" "users"
```

---

### d. Finding Exposed Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
PII is an invaluable target for attackers. Search for exposed documents containing personal data, such as Social Security numbers, credit card information, email addresses, and phone numbers.

#### **Dorks:**
```
filetype:xls OR filetype:csv "SSN" OR "Credit Card" OR "email" OR "phone"
filetype:pdf "personal data" OR "private information" OR "confidential"
filetype:csv "social security" OR "tax ID" OR "credit card"
```

---

### e. Searching for Exposed Endpoints and API Keys
Misconfigured or unprotected endpoints can provide access to internal systems, allowing attackers to exploit the system further.

#### **Dorks:**
```
filetype:json OR filetype:xml "api_key" OR "API_SECRET" OR "access_token"
inurl:"/api/" "v1" OR "key" OR "endpoint" OR "access_token"
site:example.com filetype:json "api_key" OR "api_secret" OR "token"
```

---

## 2. Identifying Misused Functionality and Logic Flaws
This step involves refining searches for vulnerabilities in application functionality that could lead to severe security risks, such as **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**, **SSRF**, or **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**.

### a. Identifying IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References)
IDOR allows attackers to directly access objects or resources they should not have access to (e.g., files, images, or records).

#### **Dorks:**
```
inurl:"id=" OR inurl:"file=" OR inurl:"image=" -github
inurl:"?file=" OR "?doc=" OR "?img="
site:example.com inurl:"/docs/" "file=" "pdf" OR "image"
```

---

### b. Discovering SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) Vulnerabilities
SSRF vulnerabilities allow attackers to trick a server into making requests to internal systems, potentially exposing private resources.

#### **Dorks:**
```
inurl:"localhost" OR inurl:"127.0.0.1" "admin" OR "config" "port"
inurl:"localhost" OR inurl:"0.0.0.0" "database" OR "redis"
inurl:"127.0.0.1" "file://" OR "http://localhost"
```

---

### c. Exploiting Misconfigured Cloud Services and Metadata
In 2025, cloud misconfigurations are a growing threat. Misconfigured services in cloud environments like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure can lead to sensitive data leaks, SSRF, or RCE.

#### **Dorks:**
```
filetype:json "AWS_ACCESS_KEY" OR "AWS_SECRET_KEY"
filetype:ini "cloud_config" OR "token" OR "auth_key"
site:example.com inurl:"cloud" "AWS" OR "Azure" "secret_key"
```

## **3. Analyzing the Results and Digging Deeper**
Once youâ€™ve gathered a list of results, follow these steps to extract deeper insights:

- **Analyze Exposed Data**: Review sensitive files such as database dumps, backup files, or configuration files. Look for usernames, passwords, API keys, or any sensitive data that can be exploited.
  
- **Look for Logic Flaws**: Check for potential vulnerabilities such as hardcoded secrets, logic errors, or weak authentication mechanisms exposed through code or configuration files.

- **Test for Exploits**: Once you've found potential attack vectors like exposed API keys or misconfigured endpoints, you can test these vulnerabilities with fuzzing tools like **Burp Suite**, **OWASP ZAP**, or custom scripts to confirm their exploitability.

- **Security Research and Exploitation**: 
  If you're authorized to exploit the vulnerabilities you've found, you may use penetration testing tools such as **Metasploit**, **Nmap**, **Hydra**, or **Burp Suite** to exploit identified weaknesses.

## 4. Additional Advanced Tools and Techniques
Google dorking is powerful but should be complemented with other techniques and tools:

- **Shodan**: Use Shodan to search for exposed devices, services, and unsecured ports globally. It can help discover vulnerable web servers, databases, and IoT devices.
  
- **Censys**: Censys is another search engine for internet-wide scans, great for finding exposed cloud services, databases, and vulnerable services.

- **Burp Suite / OWASP ZAP**: These advanced tools can be used to actively exploit vulnerabilities or enumerate endpoints, including SSRF and IDOR.

- **Crawling and Scraping Tools**: Use advanced crawling tools like **Scrapy** or **Gobuster** to automate the process of finding exposed files or endpoints, especially in large-scale bug hunting engagements.

## 5. Ethical Hacking Guidelines
> **Follow these ethical principles when performing reconnaissance:**

1. **Obtain Permission**: Only perform testing where you have explicit authorization (e.g., Bug Bounty Program).
2. **Follow Legal Boundaries**: Ensure compliance with laws and regulations.
3. **Report Responsibly**: Submit vulnerabilities via responsible disclosure programs.

---

## 6. Bug Bounty Programs
Submit findings to bug bounty platforms for potential rewards:
- **[HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/)**
- **[Bugcrowd](https://bugcrowd.com/)**

## Conclusion
This guide provides advanced Google Dorking techniques for **manual bug hunting**. It helps uncover **exposed credentials, misconfigurations, and critical vulnerabilities**.
